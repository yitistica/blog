Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog. I am Yi, a data scientist based in Shenzhen.

After a long stretch of working relentlessly as a consultant, I made up my mind for a change. Recently, I've found myself with a bit more breathing room in my schedule, I've decided to seize this opportunity to start blogging, consolidating my previous scattered notes, sharing new ideas, industrial insights, technical tricks and even something a bit of my personal opinions (if no one minds) with those who stumble upon my site.

For the past few years, I've been diving in the world of data science professionally, collaborating with different financial institutions to develop machine learning applications. Lately the emergence of generative AI has ignited everybody's curiosity, including mine. I've been exploring the field of generative AI and its applications in the financial industry.
