Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog. I am Yi, a data scientist based in Shenzhen of China.

After a long stretch of juggling projects and racing against relentless deadlines, I made up my mind for a change. Recently, I've found myself with a bit more breathing room in my schedule, I've decided to seize this opportunity to start blogging, sharing ideas and technical insights online with the people who stumble upon here..

For the past few years, I've been diving in the world of data science professionally, collaborating with different financial institutions to develop machine learning applications. Lately the emergence of generative AI has ignited everybody's curiosity, including mine. I've been exploring the field of generative AI and its applications in the financial industry.
